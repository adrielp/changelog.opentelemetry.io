# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run linting with ESLint
- `npm test` - Run Playwright tests
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Playwright UI
- `npm run test:debug` - Run tests in debug mode
- `npm run test:visual` - Run visual regression tests
- Testing: Use `/api/test` endpoint in development mode only (accessible via Test Controls button)

## Development Approach
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) when implementing new features
- Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement the feature
- Use Playwright for visual regression and integration testing
- Add data-testid attributes to elements for reliable test selection
- For API changes, use the test endpoint or create simple test scripts
- Verify changes work in both development and production builds

## Code Style Guidelines
- TypeScript: Strict mode with strictNullChecks enabled
- ESLint: Extends Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript configs
- Imports: Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for src directory
- Components: Use functional React components with TypeScript types
- Error handling: Use try/catch with specific error types when possible
- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- Styling: Use Tailwind CSS with custom theme extensions
- State management: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect)
